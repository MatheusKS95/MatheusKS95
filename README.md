### Hi there üëã
I'm Matheus K. Schaefer, a programmer from Brazil. I'm interested in multimedia and tools programming, mostly in "lower level" programming languages such as C.

#### Things I'm working on üî≠
I'm a freelance programmer. I use Bitbucket to host most of my own projects, with some moving to Gitlab, Github is mostly a dump for other stuff. I'm currently working in a videogame of my own. I'm also working with helper libraries for video game development, real-time rendering and utilities. Most of my code is written in C, but I know other languages as well (including, but not limited to: Java, C#, Lua, JavaScript).

#### I'm learning üå±
Currently I'm learning SDL's GPU graphics API (WIP at the time I wrote this) and WGPU-native (also WIP) in order to work on my games and to improving my C and shading knowledge, also having some understanding of OpenGL (3.3+). I'm also learning new libraries (and creating them) and using them to work with my tools.

#### Portfolio üß≤
You can see my portfolio [here][portfolio]. It's WIP however and needs improvements.

#### Note
All my publicly available repositories are my own personal projects. No work-related code is available here (due to NDAs and trade secrets).

#### Question
If proprietary companies use my code, or open source code, to train their AIs without regard for the license of such code, may I use leaked proprietary code to train my AI? Does that fall under fair use as well?
